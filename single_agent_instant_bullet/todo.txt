NEURAL NETS:
	Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG): DDPG is a model-free, off-policy algorithm that is designed to handle continuous action spaces. It uses a deep neural network to approximate both the Q-value and the policy, and learns to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted Q-value and the target Q-value.

	Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO): TRPO is a policy optimization algorithm that uses a trust region to ensure that the policy update does not deviate too far from the current policy. It has been shown to be effective in continuous control tasks.

	Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): PPO is a policy optimization algorithm that is similar to TRPO but is more sample efficient. It uses a clipped surrogate objective to ensure that the policy update does not deviate too far from the current policy.

	Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3): TD3 is a variant of DDPG that uses twin Q-networks and delayed policy updates to improve stability and prevent overestimation of the Q-values.

	Soft Actor-Critic (SAC): SAC is a model-free, off-policy algorithm that is designed to handle continuous action spaces. It uses a soft value function and an entropy regularizer to encourage exploration and improve robustness.
